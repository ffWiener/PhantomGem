# PhantomGem

#### Warning - This can/will allow you to purchase key items for which you have not unlocked via prerequisites.  Please use at your own risk and do not blame me if you get banned.  This add-on is meant to remove the menu-lag interaction and add macro-ability to phantom gem NPC purchases.


Example:
//pg stygian - will purchase 'Stygian Pact phantom gem'
//pg odin - will also purchase 'Stygian Pact phantom gem'

//pg maiden - will purchase "Maiden phantom gem"
//pg lilith - will purchase "Maiden phantom gem"

The rest of the shortcuts may be found in the shortcuts variable inside the lua.

You must be within 6 yalms of an appropriate NPC to use this.

//pg reset will attempt a menu reset, but this is untested.
